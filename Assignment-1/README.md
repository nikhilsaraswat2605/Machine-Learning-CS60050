# Machine Learning - Assignment 1

## Files present  

`src` files:  
- `q1.py` - Main file for completing decision tree and all tasks required.
- `Dataset_A.csv` - Contains the data for training the decision tree.
- `requirements.txt` - Contains all the necessary dependencies with their versions.

`plots` files:  
- `before_pruning.gv.png` - Image of the decision tree obtained after Q2, i.e., the best tree after 10 random splits.
- `best_depth.gv.png` - Image of the decision tree obtained after Q3, i.e., the tree with best depth limit.
- `after_pruning.gv.png` - Image of the decision tree obtained after Q4, i.e., after pruning.
- `depth_accuracy.png` - Plot of test accuracy v/s maximum depth.
- `nodes_accuracy.png` - Plot of test accuracy v/s number of nodes in the tree.

`txt` files:  
- `output.txt` - Contains output of all 
- `D_Tree_after_pruning.txt` - Decision Tree Before Pruning
- `D_Tree_after_pruning.txt` - Decision Tree After Pruning



## Instructions to run the code

- Ensure you are using a latest version of Python3, and install all dependencies.  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Execute the file `main.py`  
`python main.py`
- Images of the three decision trees and the two plots will be created in the same directory.
